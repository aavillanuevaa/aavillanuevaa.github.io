      <p className="text-subtext">Hello, my name is Angelo Villanueva. I am a third-year Computer Science student at the University of Central Florida, pursuing a minor in Mathematics. I have been accepted into UCF’s accelerated BS-to-MS program and am currently taking graduate-level courses.</p>
      <p className="text-subtext pt-3">I have experience with Python, Java, JavaScript, C, React.js, HTML, CSS, Tailwind CSS, and PyTorch, and I enjoy applying these skills to projects that challenge me to learn and grow. While I haven’t settled on a specific area of specialization yet, I am open to exploring all aspects of computer science and finding where I can make the most impact.</p>
      <p className="text-subtext pt-3">Outside of academics, I pursue creative hobbies like dance and sewing, which help me approach problems with a fresh perspective. I aim to combine technical skill, creativity, and curiosity in everything I do, both in my studies and in my projects.</p>
